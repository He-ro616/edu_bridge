# IMPORTANT

# ✅ MAIL_USERNAME
# This is the email address used to log in to the SMTP server (Gmail in your case).

# It is used behind the scenes to authenticate and send emails through Gmail's servers.

# Think of it like:
# 🔐 "Who is sending this email via SMTP (server authentication)?"

# ✅ MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER
# This is the "From" address that appears in the email seen by the receiver.

# If not explicitly set in the Message(...), this will be used as the sender address.

# Think of it like:
# ✉️ "Who does the receiver see this email is coming from?"
