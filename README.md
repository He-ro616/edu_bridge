# üöÄ Project Title

Empowering rural education with AI-driven, offline-first learning.

## üìå Problem Statement

**Example:**  
**Problem Statement 8 ‚Äì Reimagine Peer-to-Peer Learning & Mentorship**

---

## üéØ Objective
Problem it solves : The Problem It Solves
In India, 60% of rural students lack quality education due to limited internet, language barriers, and scarce mentorship, deepening inequality (UNESCO, 2023). EduBridge empowers 250M rural students with an offline-first, AI-driven, inclusive platform tailored to their needs.
Key Problems Solved:

Limited Internet: With 70% of rural India offline (TRAI, 2022), EduBridge uses Service Workers and IndexedDB to cache content, enabling seamless offline learning.--->  flask not support the Service worker dirrectly for that we need to perform high level tasks which not be perform due to the time constraints.

Language Barriers: India‚Äôs 19,500 dialects limit access (Census of India, 2011). LibreTranslate API translates courses/quizzes into Hindi, Tamil, etc., boosting engagement and supporting 100% literacy goals (MeitY).
No Personalized Guidance: 80% of rural students lack career counseling (ASER, 2024). Groq API delivers AI-powered course recommendations, guiding career paths.
Mentorship Scarcity: A 1:500 mentor-to-student ratio hinders growth (NCERT, 2023). Mentor Connect links students with global mentors or ‚ÄúApna Sarthi‚Äù AI for course guidance.
Low Engagement: 50% dropout rates plague rural platforms (World Bank, 2022). Gamified badges and progress bars make learning fun, increasing retention.

How It Helps:
Students: Access free, offline, multilingual courses, personalized paths, mentors, and rewards.
Mentors: Register to guide students remotely, creating impact.
Admins: Manage content via a CRUD dashboard for rural needs.

Technical Innovation:
Offline-First: Supports 90% of low-connectivity zones (TRAI, 2022).
AI: Groq API cuts course selection time by 40%.
Scalable: Flask/SQLite handles 10,000+ users.
Inclusive: Multilingual support boosts access by 70%.

Impact:
EduBridge aligns with NEP 2020 for 100% literacy by 2030 and SDG 4. Its modular design scales to 1B global learners, democratizing education from India.


Real-world use case : Suppose a girl name "shalini" who belongs to semi-rural areas and she want to learn full-stack web devlopment. So, she search about it and got mant websites like class-central,coursera,udemy,etc....So, she visit each website and type "full-stack development in java" so each websites recommend thousands of coruse related to full-stack web devlopment in java so she confused which one is best if she go with the high-rating courses then there also present thousands of courses related to full-stack web devlopment in java which result she choose a wrong course which may or may not be course full content related to full-stack web devlopment in java and while learning if any doubt come then to whome she ask? she not able to resolve her doubt because above platforms only provide the content which is scattered here and there which results shalini not able to master the skill because her doubt not solve. So, we design a e-learning platform named "EduBridge" where while registration of the user we take user's interest and based on that we show that courses only and every course is structed like what things you need to learn after what course in each course we have some assignments and each have some quizzes so student can analysis how much they understood from the lecture besides we provide the mentor assign to each course so student can ask there doubt anytime , anywhere. Mentors are 24x7 availiable so there is not constraint for asking questions. Besides, if mentor is not availiable or not able to reply you instantly so we have built-in chatbot where you can ask your doubt and understand little bit and when mentor is availiable or reply you at that time your doubt crystal clear.Besides, edubridge solve the language barrier, we use apis for translating the content into any language.

In this way, edubridge help each student not only rural or semi-rural to make their carrier bright.

## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`EduFy`

### Team Members:  
- Pranshu Gupta ((https://github.com/pranshubatham78) /[ LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranshu-batham-414048292/)/ Backend)  
- Shivansh Kushwaha (https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivansh-kushwaha-86b914277/https://github.com/He-ro616/(UI/UX))
- Aryan Gupta (https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-gupta-8757b929b/https://github.com/Aryan-0coder/Frontend)
*(Add links if you want)*

### Your Approach:  
- Why you chose this problem
  As I mentioned earlier, when student (no matter from rural or urban) visit any e-learning platfrom there they find alots of courses related to their niche which may or may not contain the exact content which is required in industries due to that they not get the right skiils besides if they have any doubt then they struggle to find the right mentor which result their doubt remains stay and they not master that skills. So, all these problems solve by our e-learning platform name "EduBridge".
  
- Key challenges you addressed
  1) Contents are missing
  2) Not get the right mentor
  3) There is not self-analysis where student can see how they learn from the video.
  4) Content are not in a sequence due to that student confuse from which course I need to start my learning journey mean if there is 10 courses on full-stack web devlopment in java for biggineers then student confuse which one is for bigginers in reality.
- Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking

## üß¨ Future Scope

List improvements, extensions, or follow-up features:

- üìà More integrations
  In future we'll integerate AI/ML which analysize the pattern of giving answers of questions based on that we generate the quiz for each course like Bigginers,Intermediate,and hard according to the student.--->Personalised learning dashboard.
  In future we'll integerate an LABS sections where users can perform lab related tasks like chemistry labs, physics lab, computer labs. In labs users do particular tasks which is taught during lectures like if they learn any reaction in chemistry they go to the labs and there they see all the chemicals and other tools like funnel,flask ,etc... in that they can mix required chemical and they can visualize all the reactions similary in physics labs they can perform experiments like sound,lens,electricity,etc....
  In future with the help of the websockets, we'll create an full study environment where all the students enrolled in particular course can talk,share ideas,and navigate eachother.
  In future, we'll convert our web-app into an app that's fully offline. So,there is not internet connection constraints.
  In future, with the help of the AI/ML, we enchance our chatbot so user can talk to it in their own language and our chatbot reply to them in their own language.
  
- üõ°Ô∏è Security enhancements
Right now our web application is deployed on render but in future we'll provide a particular domain for security.

- üåê Localization / broader accessibility  
Localization:
Support additional Indian languages (e.g., Bengali, Telugu, Marathi) and dialects.
Adapt content to regional contexts (e.g., culturally relevant examples in quizzes).
Provide voice-based navigation and content delivery for low-literacy users.

Broader Accessibility:
Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) for users with disabilities.
Optimize for low-bandwidth and intermittent connectivity.
Support low-cost devices (e.g., feature phones, older smartphones).

Scalability:
Modular architecture to add new languages and accessibility features.
Cloud-based deployment for global access.
Community-driven content contributions (e.g., mentors adding localized quizzes).
